# About Me

Bakhat Begum,

I am currently enrolled in a software development bootcamp at CodeYourFuture.
As a dedicated and hardworking student, I am committed to pursuing my career goals as a software developer in the tech industry hopefully.

## ShowCase

I have created several projects during my spare time, including Passenger-Account, Blackjack-game, Mobile-configure, and Basic-calculator. Additionally, I have also worked on some projects offered by CYF. Through the CYF platform, I have learned a variety of foundational principles for front end development, including not only coding but also deploying and interacting with Github. Furthermore, I have gained valuable experience in creating responsive websites.
