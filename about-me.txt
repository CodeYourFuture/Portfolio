Hi! My name is Anna. I am a persistent introvert who enjoys building and whatching things from the beginning.
The first language I was introduced to was Pascal at school when no one heard about C# or Phython yet &#x1F9D0 however the main principles of if statements are still the same. Unfortunately i was not able to continue my coding path that time.
My life path had broght to a point where I learnt about network architecture and loved it so much that decided to become a specialist in cybersecurity. So i entered the university where I learnt about C# and Java but only basics.
Unfortunaely the war started in my country did not let me to continue the education. I tried to attand online courses but theory without practice is very weak skill. but in 20 years time this world is still magnificent to me and an every solved coding task for me is still as a huge victory which i enjoy every time &#x1F60A.
Code Your Future helped me to come back into IT world. I've learnt basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but the most important they taught me how to learn further correctly and constantly develope my skills. 
The most sugnificant reward for me is when people like using things that i did.
