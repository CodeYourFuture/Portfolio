        <h2 class="c-section__title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="c-section__text">
          I am a former biomedical scientist who has transitioned into a role as
          a refugee case worker at a charitable organization dedicated to
          supporting refugees and asylum seekers as they integrate into society.
          In my daily responsibilities, I am deeply involved in assisting
          clients in their quest to find suitable educational institutions and
          housing while offering them unbiased information and guidance.
          <br /><br />

          My role encompasses a diverse range of tasks, with a primary focus on
          facilitating access to essential welfare support and financial
          benefits, particularly for individuals who may not be well-acquainted
          with the intricacies of the system. Beyond my professional
          commitments, I hold a profound passion for technology and its
          potential to bring about transformative changes in people's lives.<br /><br />

          My introduction to Code Your Future occurred during my research into
          services that could benefit our clients, and I quickly realized that
          it resonated perfectly with my personal values and aspirations.
          Assisting refugees in rebuilding their lives has long been a deeply
          ingrained goal of mine, and I view coding as the ideal avenue to
          accomplish this mission. <br /><br />

          I am driven by a strong desire to acquire programming skills and
          employ them to create a meaningful and positive impact. My commitment
          to perpetual learning remains unwavering, and I intend to harness my
          background as a refugee case worker to excel in the technology sector,
          contributing to the betterment of both individuals and communities.
