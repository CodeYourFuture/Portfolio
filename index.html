                            As a driven, adaptable, and innovative professional, I've recently transitioned into the
                            tech
                            industry.
                            My journey in software development began with an intensive program at Code Your Future
                            Glasgow,
                            where I
                            graduated in ....
                        </p>

                        <div class="collapse" id="collapseDetails">
                            <div class="card-body bg-when-show">

                                ● In the course of my professional journey, I have cultivated a
                                diverse set of skills, ranging from office management to
                                6G arc welding certification, extending to more complex fields like psychology and
                                recently, I have
                                developed a keen interest in powerful and promising AI tools.
                                <br>
                                ● My world is comprised of a few strong elements and fundamental aspects which include
                                connecting with nature, hitting
                                the gym, playing chess, and listening to audiobooks. For me, these activities are as
                                delightful as enjoying coffee with
                                a piece of cheesecake.
                                <br>
                                ● I am particularly
                                adept at HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                                Node.js, React, and SQL databases. I have always been a passionate problem solver. I
                                find joy in tackling challenges and
                                delivering innovative solutions to real-world issues. This makes me creative and
                                extends beyond just coding. I'm
                                enthusiastic about leveraging my creativity to develop new functionalities, services,
                                and solutions with real impact.
                                <br>
                                ● As a multilingual professional, I add
                                diversity to any team. I bring
                                strong communication and leadership skills, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to
                                excellence.
                                <br>
                                ● My adaptability and organization enable me to function effectively within a team
                                environment. Furthermore, my innovation
                                drives me to continually seek opportunities to bring new and needed functionalities,
                                services, or products to the real
                                world through software development. I am always seeking ways to improve existing
                                processes and systems.
                                <br>
                                ● As a lifelong learner, I am passionate about staying at the forefront of new
                                technologies. For instance, I've
                                enthusiastically immersed myself in the AI sphere from its early public-access days,
                                dedicating hours each day to
                                exploring, learning, and mastering using its tools. I firmly believe AI is poised to
                                revolutionize the tech industry and
                                coding environment, and mastering to use those tools and its potential is a valuable
                                asset.

                                ● My unwavering commitment to any project or pursuit I undertake is another key
                                strength.
                                I subscribe to the mantra of 'go
                                big or go home.
                                <br>
                                ● Above all, my enthusiasm for challenges motivates me. I enjoy overcoming obstacles and
                                seeing challenging projects
                                through to successful completion. Perhaps most importantly, I pride myself on my
                                adaptability, mental resilience, and
                                ability to thrive in any situation. I believe these qualities equip me well to make
                                significant contributions in a
                                dynamic, forward-thinking environment."

                                My educational background might seem diverse and not directly linked to programming,
                                but it demonstrates my ability to excel in various fields. My academic journey is
                                another
                                testament to my adaptability and perseverance. For further details, please
