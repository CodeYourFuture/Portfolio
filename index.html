        <p>
          What I do and how
          In my professional life I am a coder in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js. I have run a company for 14 years 
          and help people and companies commercialize their products by matching them to customers,
          potential partners and investors. I organize tech conferences in my company Somerco and has also organised within London Tech Week.

          What separates me
          When I commit to do work or educate myself I take the opportunity to learn as much as I can. As example, when I got accepted
          into Code Your Future Code Boot Camp my group had to wait 3 months before we started. Instead of not coding then I studied 
          HTML and CSS on freecodecamp.org and got a certification from them. I was then prepared for the CYF course once it started.
          I use my previous experience I gained as an analyst at a research institute and as an accredited lobbyist at the EU
          parliament to think out of the box. I have developed new analytical models provided input on job growth, trade,
          innovations, entrepreneurship, International business, energy, societies infrastructure and governmental agreements. My
          broad understanding of different topics and ability to quickly break down problems helps me in my work.

          Why it matters
          My aim in the coursework at CYF was to have a buffer to deadline so I get time to also go back and practice fundamentals.
          It matters, and give time to double check code and if not all goes as planned I have extra time and can ask for help too.
          By thinking out of the box in my company I make business increase sale quicker, brand products on new markets, innovators
          to take the step from having a product to earn more money, scientist to see the commercial and societal benefits with
          their science. An important part for b2c and b2b is to be active on events and social media to generate business leads in a clever way.
          
          In my private life I am interested in formula 1, football, ice hockey, shorinji kempo and I try to learn more about art
          and history.
