        <p class="c-section__text">
          I am a biomedical scientist turned refugee case worker at a charity
          supporting refugees and asylum seekers in their integration into
          society. My daily tasks involve aiding clients in finding suitable
          educational facilities and housing, as well as providing independent
          information and guidance. My role is multi-faceted, with a focus on
          facilitating access to welfare support and financial benefits,
          especially for those unfamiliar with the system. In addition to my
          work, I am passionate about technology and its potential to transform
          lives. I discovered Code Your Future while researching services for
          clients and found it perfectly aligned with my values. Assisting
          refugees in rebuilding their lives has always been a personal goal,
          and coding is my dream avenue for achieving this. I'm eager to learn
          programming and apply my skills to make a positive impact. Committed
          to continuous learning, I plan to leverage my experience as a refugee
          case worker to excel in the tech sector. <br /><br />
