## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
This help me learn how to control the layout of a website using Grid.

In this project, I use number Grid-column and Grig-row for the first time and It was exiting. 

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  grid-column:2/-1;
  grid-row:3/3;
}
```


### Continued development

I would try to make this website even more advance using React once I learned it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for CSS transition. I really liked its material and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing websit  which helped me finally understand CSS animations. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning Animations.
